# Discord.js

**Discord.js is a JavaScript library that allows developers to interact with the Discord API. It allows developers to create bots and automate tasks on a Discord server. The library provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with the Discord API, including functionality for sending and receiving messages, managing server members, and more.**

**It uses an event-based system, which means that bots can respond to events such as message or voice state updates, and take actions based on those events. Discord.js also provides a rich set of utility functions for common tasks, such as formatting messages, checking permissions, and more. It is compatible with Node.js and can be easily installed via npm (Node Package Manager). It is an open-source project, and contributions from the community are always welcome.**
